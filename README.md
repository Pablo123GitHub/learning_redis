## Learning Redis

Following a [Lynda.com tutorial](https://www.lynda.com/Redis-tutorials/Learning-Redis/642501-2.html) to 
learn the basics of Redis.

## Technology practiced:  

- Node JS 
- NPM ([ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) package for node js)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) 
- ES6 Javascript

## To get started 

Open a terminal window and navigate to a convenient location in your local computer, then type in terminal : 

```
git clone https://github.com/Pablo123GitHub/learning_redis.git 
cd learning_redis
npm install 
npm start
```

If the redis server is installed and running in your local machine, you will see lists, sets, ordered sets and hashes 
displayed on Terminal. Those are basic examples to test the basic redis syntax using ioredis (in Node JS ).
